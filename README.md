# Maze Generator and Solver
This project is an visualisation of maze generation and solving, implemented in Rust using the macroquad library for visualisation.

## Features
  1. Generates mazes using the following algorithms:
    1. Recursive Backtracking algorithm
    2. Randomized Prims algorithm
    3. Randomized Kruskals algorithm
    4. Aldous-Broder algorithm
    5. Wilsons algorithm
  2. Solves mazes using the following algorithm:
    1. Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm
  3. Visualisation of the generation and solving process in real-time.
